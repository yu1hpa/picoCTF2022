# Torrent Analyze

### Description
> SOS, someone is torrenting on our network.
> One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network.
> Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like picoCTF{filename}.

### Solution
The file has a Hash.
Base on Hash, you find the specific file.

Load the packet file(`torrent.pcap`) into WireShark.
And, search the strings. (Ctrl+F)

If you type `hash`, you can find `info_hash` strings, and copy the Data.
